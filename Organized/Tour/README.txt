---------- Tour Program ----------

	This program was designed to 
	use image processing 
	techniques to try and have nao
	give a tour of the computer 
	science and physics hallway.
	
	Do to stability issues with
	how nao walks and taking 
	pictures it could not be 
	complete.  However if the
	camera has stability this
	program should still work.
	
1)	Raspberry Pi

	The image processing techniques 
	are completed but it does not 
	interface with anything. Images
	are still hardcoded and should
	talk to nao over a socket.
	
	run: python main.py
